\chapter{Overview}\label{sec:overview}

\cxoneflow has origins in CxFlow for the CxSAST product, which is the predecessor to Checkmarx One.  CxFlow
had a variety of functions and deployment options related to orchestrating scans in CxSAST and sending
result feedback to issue trackers.  \cxoneflow will also orchestrate scans but is adaptated to the
concepts of CheckmarxOne.

The \cxoneflow logic of how scans are orchestrated is still very much the same as CxFlow.  The basic
logic flow is that scans are executed when:

\begin{itemize}
    \item If a Push is made to a repository's protected branch, that protected branch is scanned.
    \item If a Pull Request is opened that targets a protected branch, a scan is performed on
    the source branch.
    \item If a Push is made to a branch that is the source of an open Pull Request that targets
    a protected branch, that branch is scanned.
\end{itemize}
