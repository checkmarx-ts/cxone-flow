\chapter{Deployment}\label{sec:deployment}

If you've created a YAML configuration (Section \ref{sec:op-config}), configured your SCM to emit webhook events
(Part \ref{part:scms}) and know your runtime configuration requirements (Section \ref{sec:runtime-config}) then
you are ready to deploy.

\section{Obtaining the Container Image}

\cxoneflow is published as a container image.  If using Docker, the latest image can be pulled and cached locally
with the following command:

\begin{code}{Caching the \cxoneflow Container Image Locally}{}{}
docker pull ghcr.io/checkmarx-ts/cxone/cxone-flow:latest
\end{code}

\noindent\\While \cxoneflow is open source, making your own modified image may be difficult to support.  All
support for \cxoneflow is provided by Checkmarx Professional Services.

\section{\cxoneflow Execution}

The following is an example of a command where \cxoneflow starts and is ready to accept webhook events:

\begin{code}{\cxoneflow Example Execution}{}{}
docker run \
    -v $(pwd)/config.yaml:/opt/cxone/config.yaml \
    -v $(pwd)/secrets:/run/secrets -p 8000:8000 --rm -it \ 
    ghcr.io/checkmarx-ts/cxone/cxone-flow:latest
\end{code}

\noindent\\This executes the container with your defined \texttt{config.yml}, mapping a local directory
containing secrets files to \texttt{/run/secrets}, and exposing port 8000 locally for receipt of 
webhook payloads.
