\chapter{Deployment}\label{sec:deployment}

If you've created a YAML configuration (Section \ref{sec:op-config}), configured your SCM to emit webhook events
(Part \ref{part:scms}) and know your runtime configuration requirements (Section \ref{sec:runtime-config}) then
you are ready to deploy.

\section{Obtaining the Container Image}

\cxoneflow is published as a container image.  If using Docker, the
latest\footnote{Previous versions are also available in the
checkmarx-ts \href{https://github.com/checkmarx-ts/cxone-flow/pkgs/container/cxone\%2Fcxone-flow}{package repository}.} image can be pulled and cached locally
with the following command:

\begin{code}{Caching the \cxoneflow Container Image Locally}{}{}
docker pull ghcr.io/checkmarx-ts/cxone/cxone-flow:latest
\end{code}

\noindent\\While \cxoneflow is open source, making your own modified image may be difficult to support.  All
support for \cxoneflow is provided by Checkmarx Professional Services.

\section{\cxoneflow Execution}

The following is an example of a command where \cxoneflow starts and is ready to accept webhook events:

\begin{code}{\cxoneflow Example Execution}{}{}
docker run \
    -v $(pwd)/config.yaml:/opt/cxone/config.yaml \
    -v $(pwd)/secrets:/run/secrets -p 8000:8000 --rm -it \ 
    ghcr.io/checkmarx-ts/cxone/cxone-flow:latest
\end{code}

\noindent\\This executes the container with your defined \texttt{config.yml}, mapping a local directory
containing secrets files to \texttt{/run/secrets}, and exposing port 8000 locally for receipt of 
unencrypted webhook payloads.




\section{Deployment Considerations}

\subsection{Hosting}

The \cxoneflow container is stateless, listens on port 8000 for unencrypted webhook event delivery, 
and listens on port 8443 for encrypted webhook event delivery.  It is possible to map port 80 and 443
externally to the internal container ports.  A default self-signed SSL certificate will be used
for encrypted traffic via port 8443 unless a custom SSL certificate configuration is provided.  

The number of CPU cores on the host where the container is executing may be over-allocated to other
containers or processes.  Having the container use a high number of worker processes for an over-allocated
host will degrade performance.  The operation of \cxoneflow is not computationally intense
but it does perform rapid network and disk I/O when cloning source code and communicating with
remote system APIs.

It is suggested that the \cxoneflow instances are scaled to run on different physical hosts to
ensure availability.  This will mean you'll need to place the \cxoneflow host endpoints behind 
a load balancer.  The \cxoneflow endpoint \texttt{/ping} is available for monitoring each
running instance to ensure it is alive.

\subsection{Scan Configuration Defaults}\label{sec:deployment-scan-defaults}

Scan configuration defaults can be provided at the tenant-global and project scope
in Checkmarx One.  The \cxoneflow configuration can be configured to set configuration
defaults for each scan.  It is important to understand how the Checkmarx One default
scan configurations work given the \cxoneflow configuration can override all other
settings based on how the tenant and project defaults are configured.

The configurations in Checkmarx One are defined in the tenant or project scope with a
flag that allows the value to be overridden at a lower level of configuration.  A
SAST scan default preset, for example, is generally configured at the tenant scope
as "ASA Premium" with the ability to override the preset at the project scope.  The
result is that initial scans that do not define a preset at the project scope or
at the time the scan is initiated use the globally-defined preset "ASA Premium".

Configuring the SAST preset in a project's settings to something other than
the SAST preset configured at the tenant scope will change the scan preset for that project.
If the tenant scope configuration was such that the SAST preset could not be overridden, the
option for configuring the preset would not appear in the project settings.

Configuring the SAST preset as a per-scan default in \cxoneflow will override both
the tenant and project scope settings if both are set to allow override.  The reason for this
is that the scan configuration provided to the API when a scan is initiated is considered to override
all other configuration scopes.  If a project scope configuration was such that the SAST preset could
not be overridden, then the \cxoneflow provided default preset set at the time of scan will be ignored.

The configurations at the tenant, project, and scan level scopes work based on overrides.
This causes the value of a configuration to be set by the lowest level in which it is
defined. This makes it possible to utilize the \cxoneflow per-scan defaults in a few
different ways.

If there are no per-scan defaults configured in \cxoneflow, all per-scan defaults
can be configured at the tenant scope.  This gives the flexibility to override 
the tenant scoped settings at the project scope; this is usually required so that
the project can configure scan settings that are specific to the project.

If per-scan defaults are configured in \cxoneflow, project scope settings can
still be set but will be overridden by the per-scan settings by default.  It will require
configuring the project settings and disabling override to prevent \cxoneflow per-scan
configurations from replacing the project scope configurations.  This may be confusing
to users who are not fully aware of how the scan configuration overrides work.

\subsubsection{\cxoneflow Inheritance of \texttt{filter} Settings}

The configuration scopes are implemented in Checkmarx One as overrides for all
configuration elements.  This is ideal for most elements, but not ideal for elements
such as \texttt{filter} that defines the file/folder filters in each engine.  \cxoneflow
interprets \texttt{filter} settings in each scan engine so that they are inherited
in each scope rather than overridden.

\noindent\\As an example, consider these filters defined in each scope:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Tenant Scope: "!**/test,!**/tests"
    \item Project Scope "!**/*.sql"
    \item \cxoneflow Per-Scan configuration: "!**/node\_modules"
\end{itemize}

\noindent\\After \cxoneflow applies the inheritance algorithm, the resulting file/folder filter setting at the scan scope will be:
\\\\\texttt{"!**/test,!**/tests,!**/*.sql,!**/node\_modules"}


\noindent\\From a maintenance perspective, configuring tenant-scope defaults
with override enabled (such as SAST preset) can be used to avoid configuring
per-scan defaults in \cxoneflow.  It is often desirable to also set engine-specific
file/folder exclusions at the tenant scope to avoid scanning common exclusions.  
This will likely make maintaining global settings easier in most cases given
it is common to set scan defaults at the project scope.
