BitBucket Data Center uses one or more \textbf{Project} logical unit to separate repositories
into logical groups.  Webhooks can be deployed at the \textbf{Project} scope; any changes
to a repository contained in a configured \textbf{Project} will emit webhook events.

Configuration of webhooks at the \textbf{Project} scope is generally the preferred
method of webhook deployment for BitBucket Data Center.

Webhooks can be deployed at the scope of each \textbf{Repository} if desired.  The number of repositories
in a large enterprise generally makes deployment at the \textbf{Repository} scope useful
only for testing purposes.
