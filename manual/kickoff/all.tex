\chapter{Project Onboarding at Enterprise Scale}\label{sec:kickoff}

When \cxoneflow is integrated with an SCM, scans are initiated as developers mutate
the contents of the SCM's repositories.  It is often the case, however, that a large
number of repositories are not actively under development.  This may leave several
repositories in an unknown state until a commit is made that delivers a webhook
event to \cxoneflow to initiate a scan.

The Kickoff API has been introduced in \cxoneflow to enable an external crawl-and-submit
activity of SCM repositories.  The API, along with a Python client SDK library
\footnote{The Kickoff Python client  SDK can be referenced as an external library from the \cxoneflow repository release artifacts.}, will allow
the \cxoneflow workflows to be executed on a repository's default branch using the same
push workflow executed upon receipt of a webhook event.  The Kickoff API and associated SDK library
is used by the \cxoneflowaudit tool to perform an iterative crawl of repositories that are each submitted for an initial scan.


\section{Kickoff Workflow Logic}

Each SCM event endpoint has a Kickoff API endpoint that accepts a payload containing
elements needed for initiating a scan for that SCM.  This is mainly so that projects
created when a Kickoff scan is requested are named the same as when the project
is created in response to a webhook event.

To avoid impacting scan times for production scans (such as those initiated from CI/CD
pipelines or webhook events), the server side can be configured to limit the number of
concurrent kickoff scans.  Upon receipt of a Kickoff API request, a list of scans
with a \texttt{kickoff:<scm moniker>} tag that are in the Running, Finished, or Queued
state is retrieved.  If the number of found scans is greater than or equal to the configured
maximum number of concurrent scans, the Kickoff API responds with a 429 status to indicate
the client should try later.  The response also contains the list of currently running scans.

The purpose of the Kickoff API is to perform an initial scan of repositories that have not
yet caused a webhook event that invokes the \cxoneflow push scan workflow.  For efficiency
purposes, the project is checked for any existing scans.  If an existing scan exists in the
state Running, Finished, or Queued, regardless of if it was initiated by the Kickoff API,
the response of 299 with a list of currently running scans indicates that a new scan will
not be initiated.

If no scan is found related to the Kickoff API request, a new scan is initiated.  A response
of 201 along with the details of the initiated scan and currently running scans is returned.

The \cxoneflowaudit tool will use this logic to iterate through repositories and write an
audit log for reconciling that all repositories have at least one scan.  The \cxoneflowaudit tool
can be run multiple times without initiating duplicate scans.


\subsection{Workflow Considerations}


\subsubsection{Clone Time}

The Kickoff API works synchronously to clone a repository and submit the contents for scan.  This
is significantly different than how the webhook event handlers operate.

When an SCM delivers a webhook event to \cxoneflow, it typically will not wait a long time for a response.  Most
webhook deliveries want only a response status code to indicate success or failure in processing
the event.  The \cxoneflow webhook endpoints therefore process events asynchronously after a brief
verification of the source of the webhook event.  The process of cloning a repository can take a significant
amount of time, so it is performed in the background after responding to the SCM that the event
was successfully accepted for processing.

The Kickoff API will respond to requests with the status of the scan submission.  This means the
workflow for processing the Kickoff, including cloning the repository, will execute before
a response is sent.  Clients typically will not wait longer than 30 seconds before disconnecting
and reporting a timeout.  Even if the client disconnects, the \cxoneflow process will continue
to execute and submit a scan on a successful clone.  Observing timeout errors on the client
will not always indicate failure.  

The \cxoneflowaudit tool will provide a mechanism of auditing when repositories have had
at least one successful scan.  Any integration that uses the Kickoff API as part of a custom
workflow should build in some of the same audit capabilities as \cxoneflow audit if there is
a need to validate that each repository has been scanned at least once.


\section{Server Configuration for the Kickoff API}\label{sec:kickoff-server-config}

The Kickoff API is disabled by default.  Section \ref{sec:kickoff-elements} documents the elements that
are to be added to each service definition to enable the Kickoff API.

An SSH public key is used by the Kickoff API to authenticate a client request.  A client that
securely holds the associated private key will sign a JWT that is presented to the server with each REST
request.  If the signature is verified by the public key and the content is valid, the Kickoff request is executed.

The key pair is generated by \texttt{ssh-keygen} and supports the following types of keys:

\begin{itemize}
  \item ed25519 (\texttt{ssh-keygen -t ed25519})
  \item rsa-sha-256 (\texttt{ssh-keygen -t rsa-sha-256})
  \item ecdsa (\texttt{ssh-keygen -t ecdsa})
\end{itemize}

Some \texttt{ssh-keygen} implementations will default to \texttt{ed25519}.  If the default is \texttt{rsa},
it may be required to specify the hashing algorithm used to match the supported key type.  Follow the
\texttt{ssh-keygen} to create the public/private key files.  The public key can then be referenced
by the \cxoneflow deployment and stored in the configured location for secrets.

The private key may be stored unencrypted or with password protection.  Clients should store the private key
securely along with the password.  The private key can be used with the \intlink{sec:kickoff-sdk}{Kickoff Client SDK}
to communicate with the API.

The private key and password are required by \cxoneflowaudit if it is being used to crawl SCM
repositories and submit scans to the Kickoff API.


\section{Kickoff API Clients}

This section covers programming concepts related to the \cxoneflow Kickoff API.  
Those with a with a software development background may find this section useful
if there is a need for a customized integration with the Kickoff API. The information
in this section is not required to make use of the \cxoneflow Kickoff feature.

The \cxoneflowaudit tool utilizes the concepts described in this section to perform the
first onboarding scan of repositories. Unless there is a need to create a custom integration
with the \cxoneflow Kickoff API, the \cxoneflowaudit tool should be used to perform initial repository scans.

\subsection{Prerequisites}

Clients of the Kickoff API will require an SSH private key for creating a JWT used for authentication.
The \cxoneflow server will require configuration to use a public SSH key to validate the JWT signature.
See Section \ref{sec:kickoff-server-config} for instructions about using \texttt{ssh-keygen} to generate
an SSH public/private key pair.

The Kickoff Client Python SDK will perform all required JWT operations when provided with the SSH
private key.  If integration with the Kickoff API using a different method, a third-party JWT
SDK can be used to perform JWT operations.  Documentation using other tools to integrate with
the Kickoff API is beyond the scope of this document.

For examples in how to integrate with the Kickoff API, reference the \cxoneflowaudit source code
and the associated \texttt{cxoneflow\_kickoff\_api} source found in the \cxoneflow source repository.

\subsubsection{\texttt{KickoffClient} class}

An instance of the \texttt{KickoffClient} class can be used to communicate with
the \cxoneflow Kickoff API.  Table \ref{tab:kickoff-client-ctor-params} lists the
constructor parameters that initialize the \texttt{KickoffClient} instance.

      \midrule
      \texttt{ssl\_verify} & \makecell[c]{\texttt{str}\\\texttt{bool}} & \makecell[l]{Defaults to \texttt{True}.  Can be set to \texttt{False} to skip validation

      \bottomrule
  \end{tabularx}
\end{table}


The method \texttt{kickoff\_scan} of the \texttt{KickoffClient} instance will execute a request to kick off a scan.  The
call to \texttt{kickoff\_scan} will block in the event that the server indicates that there are too many concurrent
kickoff scans.  The client will retry the kickoff operation until success or error unless a callback method is passed
and the callback method indicates the client should stop retrying the scan submit. Table \ref{tab:kickoff-scan-params}
describes the parameters.

If there is an unrecoverable error when \texttt{kickoff\_scan} attempts to submit the scan, \texttt{KickoffClientException}
is raised.

The return is a tuple:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \texttt{KickoffStatusCodes} - Indicates the server's response code.
  \item \texttt{KickoffResponseMsg} or \texttt{None} - The response to the last request, if any.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{SCM-Specific Sub-Classes of \texttt{KickoffMsg} }\label{sec:kickoffmsg-sub-classes}

The \texttt{KickoffMsg} represents a JSON payload that is sent to each Kickoff API endpoint.  The
kickoff messages describe the SCM-specific elements of repository information that is normally
extracted from the webhook events.  The provided data is used to produce a consistent \cxone
project name for the repository that is to be scanned.
